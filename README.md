A model that has gathered the data from different sources to create a dataset containing fields of author, title, and text to detect if the text(news) is fake or not.Since
textual data needs to be processed, it is converted to numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorizer and then the classification using Logistic Regression is performed.The overall accuracy of the model is roughly 98%
